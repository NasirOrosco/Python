#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
"Nas"=="Nas"
N = "Nas"=="Nas"
print(N)
#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
4==5
A=(4==5)
print(A)
#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
S= 5>4
print(S)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
I=5<6
print(I)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
R= 15>=16
print(R)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
B=5252<=4258
print(B)
