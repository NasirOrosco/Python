This outline will help solidify concepts from the Variables lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.
'''

#1) Make a int variable called x set to 0. Make a while loop that prints 
#out x and increments it by one. Make the loop run while x is less than
#or equal to 20.
x=0
while(x<=20):
    print(x)
    x=x+1


x=0
while(x<100):
    print(x)
    x=x+1
    if(x==15):
        break


Var=[1,2,3]
for x in Var:
    print(x)

VarA=["Michael","Chris","Nino"]
for x in VarA:
    print(x)
    if(x=="Chris"):
        break
x=0
while(x<=22):
    Print(x)
    x= x + 1
    if(x==18):
        break
VarB=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]
for x in VarB:
    print(X)
    if(x==18):
        break
#2) Make a int variable called x set to 0. Make a while loop that prints 
#out x and increments it by one. Add an if statement that breaks the loop
#if x equals 15. Make the loop run while x is less than 100.



#3) Make a int list with three items inside. Make a for loop that prints 
#out all the items.



#4) Make a string list with three items inside: "Michael", "Chris", "Nino". 
#Make a for loop that prints out all the items. Add an if statement that 
#breaks the loop if the item equals "Chris".


#5) Make a while loop with a common SYNTAX error.



#6) Make a for loop with a common SYNTAX error.
