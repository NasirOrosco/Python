This outline will help solidify concepts from the Mathematical Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.
'''

#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
VarOne= "Nas"
VarTwo= "Orosco"
x=VarOne+VarTwo
print(x)

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
varThree=6
varFour=10
y=varThree+varFour
print(y)

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
varFive=10
varSix=5
z=varFive-varSix
print(z)

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
varSeven=9.25
varEight=5.25
a=varSeven-varEight
print(a)

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
varNine=5
varTen=5
b=varNine*varTen
print(b)

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.
VarElevn="Alonzo"
VarTwelve=4
c=VarElevn*VarTwelve
print(c)

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
VarThirteen=25
VarFourteen=25
d=VarThirteen/VarFourteen
print(d)

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
varFifteen=3.25
VarSixteen=1.5
e=varFifteen/VarSixteen
print(e)

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
VarSeventeen=8
VarEightteen=4
f=VarSeventeen%VarEightteen
print(f)

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
varB=17
varC=7
g=varB//varC
print(g)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
varD=24
varE=6
h=varD**varE
print(h)

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error
varE=16
varF=8
n=Vare
